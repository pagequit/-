Imagine that the rules of the entire universe had been programmed into your system.
But a tiny error has crept in during that process.
If then you are the only one who applies these rules, how could you notice the error?
Imagine further, that these rules, are the universe for that kind of system.
Whould it be an error?
One might came to the conclusion that the only way to detect an error is to define them as such.
It boils down to the meaning of unintended behaviour.
So then, when ever onee defines a system, the system must behave in that way.
... linear vs non-linear systems (chaotic systems)

I say, the universe is consecutive unintended behaviour.
